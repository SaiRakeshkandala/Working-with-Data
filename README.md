# 🌟 Data Manipulation and Visualization in Python 🌟

This project demonstrates how to manipulate and analyze data using popular Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The dataset used for this task is the well-known **Iris dataset**.  

---

## 📝 Objectives  
- 📊 Filter, group, and aggregate data efficiently.  
- 🎨 Create compelling visualizations to uncover insights.  
- 🐍 Showcase Python’s powerful data manipulation tools.

---

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `data_analysis.py`: Python script containing the data manipulation and visualization code.  
- This README file for detailed project documentation.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Iris Dataset** from [Seaborn's repository](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data). It contains 150 records with the following features:  
- 🌸 Sepal Length  
- 🌸 Sepal Width  
- 🌸 Petal Length  
- 🌸 Petal Width  
- 🌸 Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation.  
- **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib** 📊: For data visualization.  
- **Seaborn** 🎨: For enhanced visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python data_analysis.py
   ```

---

## 📈 Visualizations  
The project includes the following visualizations:  
1. 📊 **Bar Plot**: Average sepal length by species.  
2. ✨ **Scatter Plot**: Sepal length vs. petal length, distinguished by species.  
3. 🔥 **Heatmap**: Correlation between numeric features.

---

## 💻 Sample Code  
```python
# Heatmap of correlations
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

---

## 🌟 Results  
- 📌 **Filtering**: Extracted rows based on conditions (e.g., petal length > 1.5).  
- 📌 **Grouping**: Computed average sepal/petal measurements for each species.  
- 📌 **Aggregation**: Counted the number of samples per species.  
- 📌 **Visualizations**: Created visually appealing charts to highlight patterns in the data.
